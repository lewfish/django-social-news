django-social-news
===================

A simple Hacker News-like social news site implemented as an exercise in using Python, Django, jQuery and Bootstrap.

I've tested it in Python 2.7.6. To run the app locally, first install pip and virtualenvwrapper. Then, invoke

```
mkvirtualenv sn
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
